# World_Cup_Update_Subscription_Service
This project is an implementation of a World Cup update subscription service, where users can subscribe to game channels and receive updates about the games from other subscribed users. The project includes both a server (Java) and a client (C++) component, using the STOMP (Simple-Text-Oriented-Messaging-Protocol) for communication.
This is implemented as a part of an assignment given to me at Ben Gurion University, as part of my Computer Science degree.
